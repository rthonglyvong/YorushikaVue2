That was where I saw him, writing something down eagerly.","","On the wooden, round table in front of him, there was a small plate with a cappuccino cup ⁠— the steam dissipated. I could imagine that it had been there long enough to cool down completely. The cup was pushed aside to make room for a sheet of loose-leaf paper, which was held in place at its end with an eraser.","","His eyes faced downwards the entire time. He kept his gaze fixed on the paper as he tapped on the table with the butt of his pencil. It was like, to him, the entire truth of the world was written on that single page. Then  - as if remembering  - he would run his pencil across the paper before he took a breath, and returned to glaring at the words before him.","","In a seat a little ways away from him, I was bored - tracing the patterns of the wooden table with my finger. The rain was showing no signs of stopping, and the bag I had with me had nothing inside that I could use to kill the time.","","I absentmindedly watched him as he kept on writing for a long period before finally putting his pencil down. Interested now, I watched him actively from my peripheral vision. He nonchalantly took the single page he had just finished, crumpled it up into a ball, and tossed it into the garbage can that was resting on the terrace. He reached his hand into the bag beside him to take out a leather notebook, a fountain pen, and an ink bottle before he returned to writing something down eagerly. This time though, he didn't stop — he didn't get stuck. He wrote smoothly. It appeared as though he was copying what he had just written onto another page — that’s the impression his movements gave me.","","As one would expect though, even he couldn't keep his concentration forever. As he stared at the eaves of the building, he laid his upper body down over the top of the table and closed his eyes. And then, just like that, with a single twitch, he stopped moving.","","The pitter-patter of the rain sounded from the roof, gently filling the terrace with white noise. From the brim of the garbage can, a single piece of paper fell - overflowing from the pile. It was lifted by the wind, rolled across the ground, and then - eventually - it reached the feet of me, who was sitting close by.","","He was laid out on the table still - no signs of moving.","","I don't remember what I was thinking.","","But at that moment, I reached my hand down quietly towards the floor, and lifted the paper to the table with my fingertips.","","Inside, a single song was written.","","Jammed within the borders of that A5, loose-leaf paper, the characters - silently standing in line - looked like they were scribbled. Above the words, there were simple symbols. Even I, ignorant as I was, could work out that it was music.","","Screech - the sound of a chair scraping against the floor brought me back to reality. I panicked, and hurriedly folded the paper into my lap before raising my head. He had woken up, and I searched for something to say to him.","","I felt the awful feeling of being a voyeur weighing down on me - I averted my eyes, and looked down.","","All of the sudden, the rain sounded thinner, quieter than I remembered.

On an unpaved road, I walked alone. There was a blank space inside of my head, the color as if painted on thickly with the purest white paint. It was the same color of those margins that he always loved.","","I kept finding myself tripping, feet getting stuck against the ground. The shoes I had worn all throughout my journey were worn out, falling apart. I passed through a rural town, passed by sparse-looking private houses, and headed towards that forest church. Noon passed, bearing down on me with dry rays of sunlight. All that circled through my mind were those words, questioning the value of a person’s life. In a split second, my foot caught something hard, and I began to tumble down towards the hard earth below me. Summer was nearing its end, and when I opened my eyes, the pale blue filled my field of vision.","","It was at that moment that it happened.","","I lifted my face, dazed, and in between the crevices of trees - I was sure that I saw his shadow.","","The pain in my feet disappeared. I tore through the thicket of forest cover, and ran as if the animal trail were seizing my legs. It didn't feel hard to breathe. I couldn't even hear the sound of my heart beating.

I tumbled through the final parts of the thicket, and escaped.","","A wide coastline and its sandy shores spread out before me. I lifted my face. From the center of that unpopular beach, a thoroughbred, beautiful stag stared at me.","","Alongside the beach, I could see a single pier stretching into the water. The stag took a backwards glance at me as it began to walk away, and dazed, I let myself follow it.","","\\"A novel that never ends is boring. A story that drags on forever with a sluggish momentum can never be beautiful.\\"","","\\"The only value of a life is in the way it ends.\\"","","The thing that supported me until the very end were those words that he gave to me. At the edge of the pier, I looked down. The waves of the Baltic Sea were a deep blue, and seemed to continue down forever - as if filled with all the colors of a gentle night. I took off my shoes. I thought back on the last few months of my journey - did he feel like this, too?","","With that thought, I jumped into the water.","","My body sunk, easier than I thought it would.

The cup was pushed aside to make room for a sheet of loose-leaf paper, which was held in place at its end with an eraser.","","His eyes faced downwards the entire time.

He reached his hand into the bag beside him to take out a leather notebook, a fountain pen, and an ink bottle before he returned to writing something down eagerly. This time though, he didn't stop — he didn't get stuck. He wrote smoothly. It appeared as though he was copying what he had just written onto another page — that’s the impression his movements gave me.","","As one would expect though, even he couldn't keep his concentration forever.

Back before the universe began, back when we had nothing.","","There was nothing at all. Complete silence.","","Could <em>that</em> be music?","","It <em>could</em>. Even in our music, rests are an important part. If you cut out everything of a song except that exact moment of a rest, it would still be music. There's a reason that people say, \\"silence is an art.” Leaving behind my own values, if someone were to say that true silence was music, I think I would be inclined to agree with them.","","A long time ago, I'm sure people spoke about a God of Art. About a God who determines the worth of any artistic work. I'm sure that God determines the worth of our music as well. I don't know whether that God is a woman or a man, but I know that, as a God, their judgment would be impartial. That God would assign value to all music in existence - whether that's the melody of a moving plankton or a work modeling complete silence.

If you were to define the whole of our lives as music, I have to wonder - what value would mine have?\\"","","Not really understanding what he was saying, I kept staring at his face.

Talent is a con artist. If you cling to it and rely on it, it's only a matter of time before you realize that it's something that only exists in fantasy.","","It's a string that you'll only look up towards from the point of giving up, when you feel unsatisfied, when you feel like you're not meeting your own ideals. But in reality, there's so much that has worth beyond that. Beauty exists, even on a dirty canvas. In roadside flowers, in the curves that develop in a jumbled mess of disorder, in muddy water, in the broken lead of a pencil. If there's someone out there who gives those things value, then there's definitely beauty somewhere within them. In short, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It doesn't matter what it is.

Back before the universe began, back when we had nothing.","","There was nothing at all. Complete silence.","","Could <em>that</em> be music?","","It <em>could</em>. Even in our music, rests are an important part. If you cut out everything of a song except that exact moment of a rest, it would still be music. There's a reason that people say, \\"silence is an art.” Leaving behind my own values, if someone were to say that true silence was music, I think I would be inclined to agree with them.","","A long time ago, I'm sure people spoke about a God of Art. About a God who determines the worth of any artistic work. I'm sure that God determines the worth of our music as well. I don't know whether that God is a woman or a man, but I know that, as a God, their judgment would be impartial. That God would assign value to all music in existence - whether that's the melody of a moving plankton or a work modeling complete silence.  I wonder what value our music would be given, in a case like that. If you were to define the whole of our lives as music, I have to wonder - what value would mine have?\\"","","Not really understanding what he was saying, I kept staring at his face.

That was where I saw him, writing something down eagerly.","","On the wooden, round table in front of him, there was a small plate with a cappuccino cup ⁠— the steam dissipated. I could imagine that it had been there long enough to cool down completely. The cup was pushed aside to make room for a sheet of loose-leaf paper, which was held in place at its end with an eraser.","","His eyes faced downwards the entire time. He kept his gaze fixed on the paper as he tapped on the table with the butt of his pencil. It was like, to him, the entire truth of the world was written on that single page. Then  - as if remembering  - he would run his pencil across the paper before he took a breath, and returned to glaring at the words before him.","","In a seat a little ways away from him, I was bored - tracing the patterns of the wooden table with my finger. The rain was showing no signs of stopping, and the bag I had with me had nothing inside that I could use to kill the time.","","I absentmindedly watched him as he kept on writing for a long period before finally putting his pencil down. Interested now, I watched him actively from my peripheral vision. He nonchalantly took the single page he had just finished, crumpled it up into a ball, and tossed it into the garbage can that was resting on the terrace. He reached his hand into the bag beside him to take out a leather notebook, a fountain pen, and an ink bottle before he returned to writing something down eagerly. This time though, he didn't stop — he didn't get stuck. He wrote smoothly. It appeared as though he was copying what he had just written onto another page — that’s the impression his movements gave me.","","As one would expect though, even he couldn't keep his concentration forever. As he stared at the eaves of the building, he laid his upper body down over the top of the table and closed his eyes. And then, just like that, with a single twitch, he stopped moving.","","The pitter-patter of the rain sounded from the roof, gently filling the terrace with white noise. From the brim of the garbage can, a single piece of paper fell - overflowing from the pile. It was lifted by the wind, rolled across the ground, and then - eventually - it reached the feet of me, who was sitting close by.","","He was laid out on the table still - no signs of moving.","","I don't remember what I was thinking.","","But at that moment, I reached my hand down quietly towards the floor, and lifted the paper to the table with my fingertips.","","Inside, a single song was written.","","Jammed within the borders of that A5, loose-leaf paper, the characters - silently standing in line - looked like they were scribbled. Above the words, there were simple symbols. Even I, ignorant as I was, could work out that it was music.","","Screech - the sound of a chair scraping against the floor brought me back to reality. I panicked, and hurriedly folded the paper into my lap before raising my head. He had woken up, and I searched for something to say to him.","","I felt the awful feeling of being a voyeur weighing down on me - I averted my eyes, and looked down.","","All of the sudden, the rain sounded thinner, quieter than I remembered.

There's a saying that hard work won't betray you. The truth is that talent will. It'll slip right through your fingers, just like that.","","But you know, Elma, I don't believe in talent. Talent is a con artist. If you cling to it and rely on it, it's only a matter of time before you realize that it's something that only exists in fantasy.","","It's a string that you'll only look up towards from the point of giving up, when you feel unsatisfied, when you feel like you're not meeting your own ideals. But in reality, there's so much that has worth beyond that. Beauty exists, even on a dirty canvas. In roadside flowers, in the curves that develop in a jumbled mess of disorder, in muddy water, in the broken lead of a pencil. If there's someone out there who gives those things value, then there's definitely beauty somewhere within them. In short, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It doesn't matter what it is.

I doubt they could sing, but they could still make sound. As long as we have sound, will it give the impression of music? If we can call percussion or the sound of applause \\"music\\", then would it be such a stretch to call the rhythm of a plankton swimming “music”, too?","","What about even further back than that? Back before the universe began, back when we had nothing.","","There was nothing at all. Complete silence.","","Could <em>that</em> be music?","","It <em>could</em>. Even in our music, rests are an important part. If you cut out everything of a song except that exact moment of a rest, it would still be music. There's a reason that people say, \\"silence is an art.” Leaving behind my own values, if someone were to say that true silence was music, I think I would be inclined to agree with them.","","A long time ago, I'm sure people spoke about a God of Art. About a God who determines the worth of any artistic work. I'm sure that God determines the worth of our music as well. I don't know whether that God is a woman or a man, but I know that, as a God, their judgment would be impartial. That God would assign value to all music in existence - whether that's the melody of a moving plankton or a work modeling complete silence.  I wonder what value our music would be given, in a case like that. If you were to define the whole of our lives as music, I have to wonder - what value would mine have?\\"","","Not really understanding what he was saying, I kept staring at his face.
