There are many works in which God has resided, but God does not exist within a single person. That is how God exists in a place just out of reach ⁠— why we touch those works as if in reverence. \nI still remember it. Him, tracing the trail of rain dripping down the window with his fingertip, caressing a diary in his arm. He was always living inside of his memories.\n\nBut you know, Amy, I think the work you left behind is important. I don't think there's anything you should change about it. Just like in Ibuse Masuji’s story, just like a giant salamander traps a frog in a grotto all while stuck itself, your work blocks the entrance, keeping anything from leaking out. I don't think anyone should overlook the memories that relentlessly try to run away.\nAnd that’s not just me thinking about your work, either. It's about keeping you locked away, too. “God lives within the work itself.” I couldn't care less about that phrase, back then. \n\nBut even now, to me ⁠— you're the closest thing to God. "

At this point, it's almost a daily routine for me.\n\nI return to my room; write down everything that happened before now in my notebook. I'm scared. I know that the days I spent with him are going to start leaking from the box of my head, bit by bit. And I know that it'll only accelerate as the days pass me by.

That was where I saw him, writing something down eagerly. \n\nOn the wooden, round table in front of him, there was a small plate with a cappuccino cup ⁠— the steam dissipated. I could imagine that it had been there long enough to cool down completely. The cup was pushed aside to make room for a sheet of loose-leaf paper, which was held in place at its end with an eraser. \n\nHis eyes faced downwards the entire time. He kept his gaze fixed on the paper as he tapped on the table with the butt of his pencil. It was like, to him, the entire truth of the world was written on that single page. Then  - as if remembering  - he would run his pencil across the paper before he took a breath, and returned to glaring at the words before him. \n\nIn a seat a little ways away from him, I was bored - tracing the patterns of the wooden table with my finger. The rain was showing no signs of stopping, and the bag I had with me had nothing inside that I could use to kill the time. "

He nonchalantly took the single page he had just finished, crumpled it up into a ball, and tossed it into the garbage can that was resting on the terrace. He reached his hand into the bag beside him to take out a leather notebook, a fountain pen, and an ink bottle before he returned to writing something down eagerly. This time though, he didn't stop — he didn't get stuck. He wrote smoothly. It appeared as though he was copying what he had just written onto another page — that’s the impression his movements gave me. \n\nAs one would expect though, even he couldn't keep his concentration forever. As he stared at the eaves of the building, he laid his upper body down over the top of the table and closed his eyes. And then, just like that, with a single twitch, he stopped moving.\n\nThe pitter-patter of the rain sounded from the roof, gently filling the terrace with white noise. From the brim of the garbage can, a single piece of paper fell - overflowing from the pile. It was lifted by the wind, rolled across the ground, and then - eventually - it reached the feet of me, who was sitting close by.\n\nHe was laid out on the table still - no signs of moving."

Above the words, there were simple symbols. Even I, ignorant as I was, could work out that it was music. \n\nScreech - the sound of a chair scraping against the floor brought me back to reality. I panicked, and hurriedly folded the paper into my lap before raising my head. He had woken up, and I searched for something to say to him. \n\nI felt the awful feeling of being a voyeur weighing down on me - I averted my eyes, and looked down.\n\nAll of the sudden, the rain sounded thinner, quieter than I remembered. The smell of early summer rose from the drenched floorboards.\n\nI met Amy on a cafe terrace, within the sound of dripping rain."

I sit on the sandy beach, taking in the lake wind. \n\nThe famous poet, Matsuo Basho, once said: \"Haikus should be written by a three-year-old child\". That quote was written in one of his letters. While I was doing some research on Basho, I found a book written about Yosa no Buson. He was a haiku poet who wrote haikus that were influenced by Basho. He thought that Shoufu - that is to say, Basho's writing style - was the correct way to write. He admired him. \n\nSo much so that, one day, Buson reached the path that Basho himself was following."

Dresser, couch, table - he didn't have any of that. There was just a small desk with a single chair in the middle of his room, an acoustic guitar leaning beside it. There was a blank space that existed in that room, a vacuum that one could say was \"pointless\" to his lifestyle. \n\nTo write a song, first he would write a draft on excess pieces of paper. Then, once he would get it all down on those A5 loose-leaf pages, he would copy it down into his notebook. That's what I saw that day at the cafe. His life certainly wasn't lavish - but he still needed money to buy ink and paper.\n\nIn addition, there were countless sticky notes affixed to his diary. Most of the pages had dates written on them and nothing else. There was always a spare diary ready in his room, and he enjoyed staring at the yet-unwritten, blank white pages. He liked to boast that they were receptacles for the imagination. From time to time, he liked to write his newest songs on the pages he had already opened in the past - it made him happy to fill in the blank spaces, bit by bit. "

Beside the old houses, I sit on a bench at the outskirts of a forest, and continue songwriting. \n\nI imagine the melody that he would write, and write it out note by note. If he was the one writing, surely this is how he would phrase it. Within the gaps of the song, he'd put in scenery just like this; make the words as sharp as thorns, as if digging into himself; use minimal rhyming; mix past and real experiences; include his habit of saying, \"I don’t care (dou demo ii)\"; show a constant yearning for the summer, a reaching for an ideal; use \"boku\" as his first person pronoun.

Seems like even heat like this can't beat out the most rambunctious kids. Somehow I managed to follow him. From time to time, the boy looks back at me, and waves his hand as if beckoning me. I realize that we're getting closer to Drottningholm Palace* the further we go. I push through a narrow alleyway and turn a corner.

It's as if, all of a sudden, the boy had disappeared. Nestled next to the single tree standing in the site is a pedestal, iron and square-shaped. Affixed to the pedestal, there's a small bench. And there, sitting on top, as if it had led me there, a statue of a small boy.\n\nAs early afternoon starts to pass, I see the clouds in their carefree way begin to play, and I start to smell the faint scent of rain in the air.\n\n* Elma says Drottningholm Palace here, but she likely meant the Royal Palace in Gamla Stan"

The atmosphere of the deserted hall made it feel like we had rented it out. Carried within the reverb, the Liszt he played sounded like falling rain.\n\nTo people like him who were serious about music, I'm sure my piano playing came off as something close to child's play. But even still, whenever I played the keyboard, he seemed really happy. Once I started on the first note, Amy wouldn't open his mouth - he'd close his eyes lightly, and breathe in deeply as if he were swimming in the sea. No matter how many times I messed up or faltered, once I finished playing, he would always give me a small round of applause. It was always at that moment, and that moment only, that I would feel like I was playing in a real concert hall. \n\nThere were no words inside of him that could reject music. Even if the notes were clumsy and awkward - they were still notes, and he embraced that with a simple kind of honesty. When I started to feel like I had played something well, he would praise me as if he had seen it coming. It was as if he was living to embody his own love for music. \n\nAnd then, one day, he stopped playing piano."

If you blow on it, it wavers; it's so fragile that it always seems like it's about to break, unreliable and imperceptibly light. But, in our daily lives, it's always there, suspended in front of us.  \n\nAnd if by chance, you get the urge to reach out and touch it, it'll snap like it's abandoning you. There's a saying that hard work won't betray you. The truth is that talent will. It'll slip right through your fingers, just like that. \n\nBut you know, Elma, I don't believe in talent. Talent is a con artist. If you cling to it and rely on it, it's only a matter of time before you realize that it's something that only exists in fantasy. \n\nIt's a string that you'll only look up towards from the point of giving up, when you feel unsatisfied, when you feel like you're not meeting your own ideals. But in reality, there's so much that has worth beyond that. Beauty exists, even on a dirty canvas. In roadside flowers, in the curves that develop in a jumbled mess of disorder, in muddy water, in the broken lead of a pencil. If there's someone out there who gives those things value, then there's definitely beauty somewhere within them. In short, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It doesn't matter what it is. The value of everything created by humans is equal. \n\nThe concept of talent - it doesn't exist, Elma.”\n\n\n<span style=\"text-align: right;\">I don't get it, Amy.</span>"

I denied what he was saying, putting my complaint into words.\n\nAs he sat me in front of the piano, he began, \"I've been thinking about this recently. Where do we find music?\" \n\nI tilted my head. He reached out his hand and tapped the keyboard with his index finger. \n\n\"Past modern and classical, past baroque and renaissance music - leaving it all behind. If you follow that framework, even if you’re left with vocals alone, you'll find hymns at the very bottom. It's the same for everyone, even for the most isolated groups of religious people.

Even in our music, rests are an important part. If you cut out everything of a song except that exact moment of a rest, it would still be music.

About a God who determines the worth of any artistic work. I'm sure that God determines the worth of our music as well.

Wherever you looked, you could see food stands lining the streets, and even the most narrow alleys filled with crowds of people. The city was vibrant, painted with the appearance of a festival. \n\nFrom within the bustling crowds, I heard the sound of music. It was a folkish sound - the timbre of a flute, a double bass, and a fiddle-like stringed instrument. It was like the Irish scale, but a completely different melody. When I followed the sound and entered the music hall it was coming from, I could see people, hands interlocked, dancing in sync with the band playing in triple time. \n\nAbsentmindedly, I wondered if he had seen this festival as well.

It was the same color of those margins that he always loved.\n\nI kept finding myself tripping, feet getting stuck against the ground. The shoes I had worn all throughout my journey were worn out, falling apart. I passed through a rural town, passed by sparse-looking private houses, and headed towards that forest church. Noon passed, bearing down on me with dry rays of sunlight. All that circled through my mind were those words, questioning the value of a person’s life. In a split second, my foot caught something hard, and I began to tumble down towards the hard earth below me. Summer was nearing its end, and when I opened my eyes, the pale blue filled my field of vision.\n\nIt was at that moment that it happened.\n\nI lifted my face, dazed, and in between the crevices of trees - I was sure that I saw his shadow. \n\nThe pain in my feet disappeared. I tore through the thicket of forest cover, and ran as if the animal trail were seizing my legs. It didn't feel hard to breathe. I couldn't even hear the sound of my heart beating.

I tumbled through the final parts of the thicket, and escaped. \n\nA wide coastline and its sandy shores spread out before me. I lifted my face. From the center of that unpopular beach, a thoroughbred, beautiful stag stared at me. \n\nAlongside the beach, I could see a single pier stretching into the water. The stag took a backwards glance at me as it began to walk away, and dazed, I let myself follow it. \n\n\"A novel that never ends is boring. A story that drags on forever with a sluggish momentum can never be beautiful.\"\n\n\"The only value of a life is in the way it ends.\"\n\nThe thing that supported me until the very end were those words that he gave to me. At the edge of the pier, I looked down. The waves of the Baltic Sea were a deep blue, and seemed to continue down forever - as if filled with all the colors of a gentle night. I took off my shoes. I thought back on the last few months of my journey - did he feel like this, too? \n\nWith that thought, I jumped into the water. \n\nMy body sunk, easier than I thought it would. A clump of bubbles clung to my face. At far beyond 0 meters sea level, my field of vision changed, blurry and indistinct. The sunrays slipped through the crevices of the pier and shined into the sea like moonlight. I had the thought that they were pretty.\n\nAmy. His words traveled through my mind. From within my blurred vision of the seafloor, I saw something shine, buried within the mud. I reached out my hand, and scooped it up. I knew what it was.\n\nI knew that fountain pen."

They were what kept me moving, as if they were the gasoline fueling me.\n\nHe always carried his choice of fountain pen and ink along with him. I'm not very bright with a fountain pen, but I learned how to use it by copying him. For someone who used it the right way though, the ink could last forever. Even if he wrote more than he usually did, how did the ink run out so fast? \n\n\n\nHe always wrote a draft before copying what he wrote into his notebook. \n\n\n\nIf the letters he sent me were “Drafts” - then this notebook.
